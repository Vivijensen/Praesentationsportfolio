                        <p>I am currently completing my two-year studies as a <b>multimedia designer</b>, and I have found my passion here. I can learn every day, enhance my skills, and simultaneously express my <b>creativity</b>. Various paths and experiences in my life have led me to this point. I originally come from western Germany. After completing my high school education, I pursued a <b>BachelorÂ´s degree</b> in Social Sciences - Media, Politics, Society. It quickly became clear to me that I wanted to move towards the field of media and continue my education and work here. During my studies, I was able to undertake <b>various internships</b> for big companies in this field, like a TV station, an airline and a chemical company. I worked in their <b>online marketing departments</b>, where I learnt to edit and cut videos, plan social media campaigns and run online marketing campaigns.</p>

                        <p>After completing my studies, I worked in a <b>global marketing agency</b> in the Amazon marketing team. I independently managed significant clients, executed campaigns for them, and increased their sales on Amazon. I also worked with SEO and optimized the product pages of respective companies. After moving to Denmark and quickly learning the language, I joined the marketing team of a Danish jewelry company. Here, I translated and created marketing materials and planned social media posts. I have worked in various departments and gained diverse experiences. However, I always felt the creative aspect of the work was missing. I wanted to further develop in this area, allowing me to pursue my passion professionally. All of this led me to my current studies in multimedia design.</p>
