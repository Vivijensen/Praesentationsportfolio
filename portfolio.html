My passion lies in presenting products in a visually captivating manner, emphasizing and highlighting their unique features.

                            <p class="text_project_1" >A picture is worth a thousand words, but a video can tell even more. I can edit and arrange videos for your company in a way that tells a compelling story and captivates the viewer. Through my time as an intern in a television editorial team, I gained profound insights into video production and independently planned and executed several projects. As part of a project in my multimedia design studies, my team produced this video, which I partially filmed and edited.</p>

                            <p class="text_project_1" >I channel my creative instincts by designing on my iPad through diverse programs like Procreate or Adobe Illustrator. Engaging in this digital canvas, I not only craft personalized hand letterings but also bring forth an array of illustrations tailored to specific needs. These illustrations serve different purposes, finding application in website design and other similar contexts. For instance, one of my projects involved creating a waffle illustration for the redesign of an ice cream café's website, adding a delightful touch to its visual identity. This fusion of creativity and digital proficiency allows me to contribute unique and visually captivating elements to various design projects.</p>

                            <p class="text_project_1" >My passion lies in portrait photography. Capturing situations visually and setting people in the spotlight brings me great joy. I have already gained experience in newborn photography, as well as family or individual shoots. After the photo shoot, I edit the images in Adobe Lightroom or Adobe Photoshop, making refinements to ensure the overall result is completely satisfying.</p>

                            <p class="text_project_1" >I've gained a lot of experience using Adobe Illustrator. I've worked on various projects using both the MacBook and iPad versions, using the Apple Pen for more precision. One project I'm proud of is a self-portrait I drew using vector-based drawing. It's been a fun journey learning the ropes of Illustrator and creating cool designs along the way!</p>

                            <p class="text_project_1" >In Adobe Illustrator, I crafted the logo for my website. It was a two-step process. First, I designed a sprite sheet, essentially a sequence of images that would form the animated logo. Each image captured a different frame of the animation. After finalizing the design, I moved on to the technical side. I generated HTML code that makes the animation possible on my website. This coding magic allows the logo to come alive, adding a playful and dynamic touch.</p>
